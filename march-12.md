Next Wednesday – making our own grading criteria for mod 3?
Andrew Reinhard:
What is compelling about archeo gaming?
•	Weird 
•	Influence from architecture in games
•	How things are designed to appear old
•	Videogames example of built heritage 
o	Built Heritage: every video game is archaeological in nature, just by being built. Games can be transposed into modern software (can be changed and “grow”) the original version of the game is the artefact. How images seen in a certain context represent archeological features. 
-	Videogames and archeology as a way of marketing / making it more appealing for people outside the industry.
-	Put your work out in the world
o	Allows for immediate feedback
o	Inspire / feed off other with similar ideas / projects
-	Surprisingly diverse field 
-	Speed of change: How we perceive time. there is a perceived permanence of the physical location. The physical location is in a state of change but in the context of our lifespan is appears less changing. We are more aware of the impermanence / change of digital material. 
-	Importance of sound: how sound enhances our experience, underused 
-	Al Harris matrix: what happened last vs what happened first
-	How “Glitches” or “flaws” are perceived as part of the artefact. If those flaws are corrected it may be considered something entirely separate from the original. Ex: part of an artifact is missing, if someone was to make a version of what the true original (without the missing piece) it may not inspire the same “connection” that the incomplete artifact did. 
o	Speaks to our perception of artifacts 
-	The negatives: 
o	Backlash to “education” aspect of it
o	Maybe too easy to accept things the way they are made, not as much focus on accuracy 
o	Influence of business and money 
o	Colonial baggage
