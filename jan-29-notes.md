Computational Creativity and the ontological meaning of your models
•	How are things connected?
o	Everything Is connected to a broader system
	Ex: computer has materials mined in areas with civil conflict, slavery, etc
•	Framework:
o	How do we determine what our models “are”
•	Do computers think is like asking if submarines swim 
•	Play or labour?
•	Archaeological theory
o	Things you dig – things you create as you dig – things you destroy when you dig
•	Victims of Vesuvius
o	Discovery of “voids” where decomposed bodies were Using casts
o	Pseudomorphs can contain biological material ( bone fragments collected in the casts, this material likely would not have been collected otherwise)
o	Pseudomorphs expressed in the material of something else (ex: iPhone app icons look like items we are familiar with) 
o	Digital creation of “non-spaces” – raises questions of is a digital creation of a “non-space” the thing it represents (is a cast of a body a body), Is it art or creative? 
•	Permeability vs persistence (see chart)
•	Enchainment vs Containment
o	Data on the object, data on the digital creation of the new object
•	Pseudomorphs are simultaneous of the past and the present 
o	Body -> Death - > decay -> Non space -> Cast / Pseudomorphs -> Decay -> recreations of Pseudomorph
o	Digital creations decay too 
•	Computational Creativity
o	Forcing us to think about the edges of our creations (time, space, etc)
o	Not Bounded but Blurred
o	History asks Why to ask why about digital artifacts we need to see these edges
•	What is the Ontological meaning of our projects
o	Project: Indian Bone china Teacup
o	Where is the creativity in your model?
	Fits into a larger personal project 
o	How do your models fit into these frameworks? Why?
	China = impermeable , 
o	What do you see when you try to map the moments, the glitches, the voids and spaces?
o	Think about these questions a little more: update notes later
