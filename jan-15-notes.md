Jan 15, 2018
2nd week:
lecture: J.mp/2Dag3hg
•	HTML, CSV, TEXT, MARKDOWN versions of hypothesis notes available (http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html)
	Sub in group instead of username to see group trends
	Create spreadsheets and see word and topic trends
•	Download photogrammetry apps 
•	Structure from motion (most popular) 
•	Bevel 3D not very good 
•	Original Digital 3D model software used large blocky triangles. Alright to see from afar but had no detail close up 
•	123Dcatch? (no longer in business)
•	Large companies buy up new technology with the interest of creating consumer grade products but never do. As a consequence, the technology stops being available for people to use at all.  
•	Check out English Heritage
Basic Principles:
	Image Capture
	Image matching
	Dense point cloud generation (takes all the image points and creates triangles)
	Secondary product generation
	Analysis / presentation

Tip: Between 20-35 photographs
